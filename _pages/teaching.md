### My Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching is rooted in the belief that the most effective learning happens at the intersection of theory and practice. In my courses, I strive to demystify complex topics in accounting and finance by grounding them in real-world data and hands-on analytical exercises. I design my curriculum to empower students not just with established knowledge, but with the critical data literacy and machine learning skills necessary to ask new questions and solve the challenges of a data-rich world. My goal is to foster an environment of intellectual curiosity where students develop the confidence to become analytical, evidence-based thinkers.
