  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  Building on the finding that intellectual capital disclosures are value-relevant, this study takes the next logical step: what determines a firm's willingness to make these voluntary disclosures in the first place? Focusing again on the knowledge-intensive pharmaceutical and chemical sectors in Bangladesh, we investigated the firm-specific characteristics that drive disclosure decisions.<br><br>
  Our research identified several key determinants, including firm size, profitability, and leverage. This suggests that disclosure strategies are not random but are influenced by a predictable set of economic incentives and corporate characteristics. It provides a clearer picture of the "who" and "why" behind voluntary reporting.<br><br>
  This project allowed me to move from studying the *consequences* of disclosure to studying its *determinants*â€”a crucial shift in research perspective. Understanding the incentives behind corporate disclosure choices is a central theme in modern accounting research and is fundamental to the work I plan to undertake in my PhD.
