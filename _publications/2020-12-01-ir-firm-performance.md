  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  In today's capital markets, standard financial statements often fail to capture the full picture of corporate value. This challenge is particularly acute in emerging economies where information asymmetry can be high. My research tackles this issue head-on by investigating the impact of a more holistic disclosure model—Integrated Reporting (IR)—in a voluntary adoption setting in Bangladesh. I sought to answer a critical question: Do firms that voluntarily provide higher-quality, more integrated reports exhibit superior performance?<br><br>
  By developing a comprehensive IR index and analyzing its relationship with key performance metrics like Tobin's Q, my findings demonstrated a clear, positive correlation. This suggests that even without regulatory mandates, the market rewards firms that offer more cohesive narratives about their strategy, governance, and value-creation process. This work provides crucial, early evidence from a developing economy, highlighting that enhanced corporate disclosure is not merely a compliance exercise but a strategic tool for value creation.<br><br>
  This study has solidified my foundation in empirical archival research and directly fuels the questions I aim to pursue in a PhD program in the USA. It underscores my passion for understanding the real-world impact of accounting standards and disclosure quality on capital market efficiency. I am eager to build upon this foundation to explore how disclosure innovations and corporate governance interact to shape investment decisions and firm outcomes on a global scale.
