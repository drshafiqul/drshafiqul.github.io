  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  "Integrated thinking" is the bedrock of the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework, suggesting that a holistic management approach can lead to better decisions and long-term value. But does it also affect the integrity of financial statements? This research empirically tests that proposition in the Malaysian market. We investigated whether firms that exhibit higher levels of integrated thinking are less likely to engage in earnings manipulation.<br><br>
  Our findings provide compelling evidence that a genuine commitment to integrated thinking is associated with lower levels of accrual-based earnings management. This suggests that a holistic, long-term perspective at the management level can enhance financial reporting quality and, by extension, create more sustainable corporate value.<br><br>
  This study was pivotal for me, as it connected the conceptual framework of IR to tangible accounting outcomes. It solidified my interest in how reporting frameworks are not just about disclosure, but about shaping internal corporate culture and ethical behavior. My goal in a PhD program is to further investigate these links between reporting incentives, managerial behavior, and the quality of information in capital markets.
