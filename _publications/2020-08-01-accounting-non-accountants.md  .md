  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  The information produced by accountants and auditors is foundational to business, yet it is primarily consumed by non-accountantsâ€”managers, investors, and regulators. This study explores the perceptions and potential misconceptions these stakeholders have about accounting and auditing in an emerging economy. We investigated how well the core principles of our field are understood by those who rely on our work.<br><br>
  Our findings reveal a significant "expectation gap," where non-accountants often have a different understanding of the assurances provided by an audit or the nuances of financial reporting. This highlights a critical need for better communication and education to bridge the gap between information preparers and users.<br><br>
  This research was instrumental in shaping my perspective on the ultimate purpose of accounting: effective communication. It's not enough to simply produce technically correct reports; the information must be understood to be useful. This user-centric view of accounting information is a core theme I wish to explore in my PhD, focusing on how disclosure design and new reporting technologies can improve information transmission in capital markets.
