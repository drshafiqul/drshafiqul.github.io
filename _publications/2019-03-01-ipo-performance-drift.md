  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  The long-run underperformance of firms following an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a well-documented puzzle in financial economics. This study provided one of the first comprehensive analyses of this phenomenon in the context of the Bangladesh capital market. We sought to determine whether the "IPO anomaly" holds true in a rapidly emerging market with its own unique institutional features.<br><br>
  Our analysis of operating and stock return data revealed a significant post-IPO performance drift, consistent with findings in more developed markets. This suggests that issues like initial over-optimism and information asymmetry at the time of the offering have a lasting impact on firm valuation, irrespective of market maturity.<br><br>
  This paper was my formal introduction to event-based empirical research in finance and accounting. It sparked my fascination with capital market anomalies and the behavioral factors that influence asset pricing. It laid the groundwork for my future PhD studies, where I aim to explore how different disclosure regimes and governance structures can mitigate the information asymmetry inherent in major corporate events like IPOs.
