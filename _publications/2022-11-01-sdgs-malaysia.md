  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for action from all sectors of society, including higher education. This research explores a novel intersection of sustainability and public sector accounting: how can universities use the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework to more effectively contribute to and report on their SDG-related activities? Focusing on Malaysian public universities, my role was to help analyze how IR could be a transformative tool for this purpose.<br><br>
  Our study concludes that IR provides a powerful framework for universities to embed sustainability into their core strategy and communicate their societal value creation more effectively. It moves beyond traditional financial reporting to showcase contributions to goals like quality education, innovation, and sustainable communities.<br><br>
  This research connects two of my core interests: the evolution of corporate reporting and the growing importance of non-financial disclosures. It fuels my ambition to investigate, in a PhD program, how sustainability reporting standards are influencing organizational behavior and investor decision-making, both in the corporate and public sectors.
