  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  The structure of a firm's leadership and ownership is a cornerstone of corporate governance and investor confidence. This is especially true in developing economies where regulatory frameworks are still evolving. This research delves into that dynamic, investigating how specific board characteristics and ownership concentration affect firm performance in Bangladesh. My contribution was to analyze the complex interplay between these internal governance mechanisms and the external regulatory pressures.<br><br>
  Our findings reveal that board independence significantly enhances firm value, providing clear evidence that robust governance structures are not just a Western concept but a vital component for success in emerging markets. This work reinforces the idea that effective governance is a critical determinant of firm performance and market trust.<br><br>
  This project was formative in developing my understanding of corporate finance and governance, a key pillar of the accounting research I am passionate about. It motivates my desire to explore, during my PhD studies, how different governance models adapt to regulatory changes and how they ultimately impact financial reporting quality and capital allocation.
