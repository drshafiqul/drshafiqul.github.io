  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  Understanding the drivers of energy consumption is critical for sustainable economic policy, particularly in rapidly growing nations like Bangladesh. This study moves beyond simple correlations to analyze the complex, dynamic relationships between four key variables: energy use, technological innovation, GDP growth, and international trade. By employing econometric modeling, I aimed to untangle this web of influences.<br><br>
  The research demonstrates that while economic growth is a primary driver of energy use, technological innovation plays a crucial role in creating efficiencies. Furthermore, trade openness introduces its own complex effects on consumption patterns. These findings have direct implications for policymakers aiming to balance economic development with environmental sustainability.<br><br>
  While this project was in economics, it honed my quantitative and econometric skills, which are directly transferable to empirical archival research in accounting. It reinforced my interest in how macro-level factors and national policies create the environment in which firms operate and make disclosure decisionsâ€”a topic central to my future PhD research goals.
