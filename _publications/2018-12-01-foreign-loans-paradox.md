  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  Foreign aid, in the form of loans and grants, is intended to spur economic growth in developing nations. However, its actual impact can be complex and sometimes counterintuitive. This study investigates this "paradox" through an econometric analysis of the Bangladeshi economy, exploring the nuanced and sometimes contradictory effects of different forms of foreign aid on key economic indicators.<br><br>
  Our findings highlight that the effectiveness of foreign aid is not uniform; its impact depends heavily on its form (loans vs. grants) and the macroeconomic context in which it is received. This provides a more granular understanding for policymakers seeking to optimize the benefits of international financial assistance.<br><br>
  This early work was foundational in building my skills in econometric modeling and analyzing large-scale economic data. While focused on macroeconomics, the core research design—analyzing the impact of external capital inflows on a domestic economy—is conceptually similar to research in accounting that examines the impact of foreign investment on firm behavior and reporting. It prepared me for the rigorous quantitative analysis required in a top-tier PhD program.
