  <strong>Research Highlight & PhD Alignment</strong><br><br>
  In a knowledge-based economy, a company's true value often lies in its intangible assetsâ€”its intellectual capital. However, traditional accounting often fails to capture this. This study tackles that gap by examining the relationship between the voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital and firm performance within the dynamic pharmaceutical and chemical industries of Bangladesh.<br><br>
  Our empirical analysis demonstrates a significant, positive relationship between the extent of intellectual capital disclosure and a firm's market valuation and profitability. This indicates that investors value transparency regarding intangible assets and reward firms that provide this non-financial information.<br><br>
  This research was a deep dive into the fascinating area of non-financial reporting and its capital market consequences. It solidified my interest in how firms communicate value beyond the balance sheet. A key goal of my PhD research is to further explore the valuation-relevance of different types of voluntary disclosures and understand the economic incentives that drive firms to provide them.
